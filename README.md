## Introduction

This is a readme file for Getting and Cleaning data - courses course project. 
To be able to run the analysis, you should first clone/copy the course_project.R 
file to a directory, where you work to. 

Then, load data from 
[data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ) and extract it to the same folder where you have the script file. 

After this, open the course_project.R script and change the working directory in the second line to your working directory (replace CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY) e.g 

```r
##change this to your directory having the data extracted and the code
setwd("C:/Users/Kipa/Desktop/kurssit/getting_and_cleaning")
```

Run through the script and you end up having tidydata.txt in your working directory. The column names can be found in Codebook.md file.
